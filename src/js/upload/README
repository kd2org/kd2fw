This is simple upload helper in JS, making things easier:

* Single file upload
* Multiple file upload (AJAX)
* File hash check before upload (Files matching a hash won't be uploade),
    this allows to avoid uploading a file that was already uploaded before
* Progress bar related to file upload

Requires those JS APIs:
* FormData (IE10+, FF4.0+, Chrome7+, Opera 12+, Safari 5+)
* FileReader (IE10+, FF3.6+, Chrome6+, Opera 11.5+, Safari 6+)
* File (IE10+, FF7+, Chrome13+, Opera 11.5+, Safari 6+)
* querySelector (IE9+, FF3.5+, Chrome4+, Opera 10+, Safari 3.1+)
* JSON (IE8+, FF3.5+, Chrome4+, Opera 11.5+, Safari 4+)

So it should work with: IE10+, FF7+, Chrome13+, Opera 12+, Safari 6+.

HTML5 progress element support is not mandatory.
